    "- Discrimination: There is a risk of discriminatory practices where advertisers may target or exclude users based on their demographics or ride history.\n",
    "- User Autonomy: The sale of personal data can undermine users' autonomy by manipulating their choices and preferences based on targeted advertising.\n",
    "- Reputational Risks: The company may face backlash from users and privacy advocates, which can lead to loss of user base and trust.\n",
    "- Legal and Regulatory Risks: Depending on the region's privacy laws (like GDPR in Europe), selling user data without explicit consent can lead to legal penalties.\n",

    "In light of these ethical concerns, it's crucial for the company to implement rigorous anonymization and aggregation processes to protect individual identities. Moreover, transparency with users about what data is being sold and offering opt-out choices can help mitigate some of the ethical risks. Regular audits and compliance checks should also be part of the strategy to ensure adherence to ethical and legal standards."
